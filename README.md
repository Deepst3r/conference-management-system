# Requirements:

• A steering committee can organize a conference, the information about the event is posted on the CMS main screen. This information includes the name of the conference, the interval in which the event will take place, the "Call for papers", the deadlines, the Program Committee, the conference sections, and the program.

## Management phases:

### 0. Preliminary phase:

 • The PC members (including the conference chair or the conference co-chairs) uploads information about their name, affiliation, email address, their personal web-page, their username for the CMS and the password for accessing the information about the conference.  

 • The chair or one of the co-chairs have the permission to change deadlines by postponing them to later data.

### 1. First phase:
• Each person interested to submit a proposal create its own user account fulfilling the information required (the name, affiliation, email address). 

• Once the account is validated, the submitter logins, submit the abstract and fulfills the meta-information required: the name of the proposal, the keywords, the topics, the possible list of authors and their meta-information).

• Depending on the conference it is possible to upload also the full paper (usually a file in .pdf or .msword format).

• Uploading proposals can be done before the deadline mentioned on the conference site and on the "Call for papers".

• It is possible to have two different deadlines: one for the abstract and another for the proposal. 

• Until each deadline, users may upload new versions both for the abstract and the paper.

### 2. Second phase:

• PC members are required to bid the proposals.

• Each PC member has to do a brief analysis of abstracts or papers in order say if they are pleased to review some papers, or if they are could evaluate some papers, or if they refuse to evaluate other papers. 

• Once the bidding process closed (there is a deadline for bidding), the conference chair or co-chairs assign to each reviewer the papers required to be evaluated. By default, any reviewer does not receive for evaluation a paper refused in the bidding phase.

• At least two different reviewers have to evaluate each paper. Usually, there are three reviewers(evaluators) for each paper but depending on the conference level there can be also 4 reviewers.

• The result of each reviewer is one of the followings qualifiers: strong accept, accept, weak accept, borderline paper, weak reject, reject and strong reject. The papers whose evaluation do not contains any level of reject are accepted by default. Also, the papers that do not contain any accept will be rejected.

• In the case of papers having contradictory evaluations, the chair/co-chairs request reviewers to discuss in order to get closer evaluations. If this will not be possible, is up to the chair to decide if another new evaluation from a different reviewer will be required or if the paper will be rejected or accepted. The evaluation qualifier is justified by means of a set of recommendations that each reviewer attaches to evaluated proposals.

• Once a reviewer upload the results of its evaluation, she/he will see the other evaluations of the same paper delivered by other reviewers.

• After deciding about the acceptance or not for all submissions, the authors are announced by email about their results.

• Only papers accepted and presented at the conference will be published. After receiving the acceptance decision, authors are invited to improve their accepted papers taking into account reviewers recommendations.

• PC members excepting the chair/co-chairs can submit proposals by logging as authors. In this case, they have not the right to see neither which are the reviewers of their paper nor the comments between reviewers.

### 3. Third phase:

• Depending on the number of participants and of accepted papers, the conference is structured on different sections, some of them organized in parallel. 

• Each section is supervised by a session chair which in most cases is a member of the Program Committee (PC member) including the chair/co-chairs. 

• Authors presenting their accepted papers are named speakers.

• Participants to each section are chair, speakers and listeners. 

• In order to assign the most appropriate rooms for each section, in case of important conferences (having hundreds of participants), these are invited to specify which are the sections they intend to participate in. 

• A speaker cannot be the chair of the section in which she/he present his paper. 

• Usually, before the presentation, speakers upload on the conference site the content of the presentation by means of a .pdf or .ppt(x) file.
